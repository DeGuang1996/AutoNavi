The Rocon Qt Listener
=====================

Currently this is a very simple pyqt script which implements the listener from the ros tutorials. 
I'd like to move this to an rqt plugin in the future with which can be parameterised for:

* title
* output message format (i.e. something different to 'I heard')
* can connect to any string producing topic
